### About

I built this plain javascript/html/css app from scratch. No external libraries, no fluff - just pure googling and bare-metal code. Uses CSS grids, media queries, and js module loading. I've added a rudimentary HTTP method helper, and Observable pattern implementation.

The main application logic is in `script.app.js`

This entire application will seem foreign to me in about a month...
